# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

To test my knowledge on:
 
- semantic HTML elements
- logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- accessible alt attributes
- heading attributes order
- add concise and discriptive title


## Usage

The point of this challenge is to improve the codebase by:
 **Refactor by improving the code without changing the webpage look to meet the latest standards, such as the Scout Rule.  

 **Web accessibility** to make sure that anyone with a disability can access the website using assistive technologies.

 **Check that all links are functioning correctly
 **Consolidating the CSS selectors and properties by using the semantic structure of the HTML elements
 **Add comments before each element or section of the page.
